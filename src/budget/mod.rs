//! Budget module - cost tracking and model pricing.
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//! - Budget: tracks total and allocated costs for a task
//! - Pricing: fetches and caches OpenRouter model pricing
//! - Allocation: algorithms for distributing budget across subtasks
//! - Retry: smart retry strategies for budget overflow
//! - Benchmarks: model capability scores for task-aware selection
//! - Resolver: auto-upgrade outdated model names to latest equivalents
//! - Compatibility: track which models support proper function calling
