# Open Agent – Project Guide

Open Agent is a managed control plane for OpenCode-based agents. The backend **does not** run model inference or autonomous logic; it delegates execution to an OpenCode server and focuses on orchestration, telemetry, and workspace/library management.

## Architecture Summary

- **Backend (Rust/Axum)**: mission orchestration, workspace/container management, MCP registry, Library sync.
- **OpenCode Client**: `src/opencode/` and `src/agents/opencode.rs` (thin wrapper).
- **Dashboards**: `dashboard/` (Next.js) and `ios_dashboard/` (SwiftUI).

## Core Concepts

- **Library**: Git-backed config repo (skills, commands, agents, tools, rules, MCPs). `src/library/`. The default template is at [github.com/Th0rgal/openagent-library-template](https://github.com/Th0rgal/openagent-library-template).
- **Workspaces**: Host or container environments with their own skills, tools, and plugins. `src/workspace.rs` manages workspace lifecycle and syncs skills/tools to `.opencode/`.
- **Missions**: Agent selection + workspace + conversation. Execution is delegated to OpenCode and streamed to the UI.

## Scoping Model

- **Global**: Auth, providers, MCPs (run on HOST machine), agents, commands, rules
- **Per-Workspace**: Skills, tools, plugins/hooks, installed software (container only), file isolation
- **Per-Mission**: Agent selection, workspace selection, conversation history

MCPs are global because they run as child processes on the host, not inside containers.
Skills and tools are synced to workspace `.opencode/skill/` and `.opencode/tool/` directories.

## Design Guardrails

- Do **not** reintroduce autonomous agent logic (budgeting, task splitting, verification, model selection). OpenCode handles execution.
- Keep the backend a thin orchestrator: **Start Mission → Stream Events → Store Logs**.
- Avoid embedding provider-specific logic in the backend. Provider auth is managed via OpenCode config + dashboard flows.

## Common Entry Points

- `src/api/routes.rs` – API routing and server startup.
- `src/api/control.rs` – mission control session, SSE streaming.
- `src/api/mission_runner.rs` – per-mission execution loop.
- `src/workspace.rs` – workspace lifecycle + OpenCode config generation.
- `src/opencode/` – OpenCode HTTP + SSE client.

## Testing

Testing of the backend cannot be done locally as it requires Linux-specific tools (desktop MCP). Deploy as root on `95.216.112.253` (use local SSH key `cursor`). Always prefer debug builds for speed.

Frontend workflow: the Next.js dashboard is run locally (no remote deploy). Point the local dashboard at the remote backend in Settings.

Fast deploy loop (sync source only, build on host):

```bash
# from macOS
rsync -az --delete \
  --exclude target --exclude .git --exclude dashboard/node_modules \
  /Users/thomas/conductor/workspaces/open_agent/vaduz-v1/ \
  root@95.216.112.253:/opt/open_agent/vaduz-v1/

# on host
cd /opt/open_agent/vaduz-v1
cargo build --bin open_agent --bin host-mcp --bin desktop-mcp
# restart services when needed:
# - OpenCode server: `opencode.service`
# - Open Agent backend: `open_agent.service`
```

Notes to avoid common deploy pitfalls:
- Always include the SSH key in rsync: `-e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/cursor"` (otherwise auth will fail in non-interactive shells).
- Build `host-mcp` and `desktop-mcp` too so chroot builds can copy the binaries from PATH.
- The host uses rustup; build with `source /root/.cargo/env` so the newer toolchain is on PATH.

## Debugging Missions

Missions are persisted in a **SQLite database** with full event logging, enabling detailed post-mortem analysis.

**Database location**: `~/.openagent/missions/missions.db` (or `missions-dev.db` in dev mode)

**Retrieve events via API**:
```bash
GET /api/control/missions/{mission_id}/events
```

**Query parameters**:
- `types=<type1>,<type2>` – filter by event type
- `limit=<n>` – max events to return
- `offset=<n>` – pagination offset

**Event types captured**:
- `user_message` – user inputs
- `thinking` – agent reasoning tokens
- `tool_call` – tool invocations (name + input)
- `tool_result` – tool outputs
- `assistant_message` – agent responses
- `mission_status_changed` – status transitions
- `error` – execution errors

**Example**: Retrieve tool calls for a mission:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/control/missions/<mission_id>/events?types=tool_call,tool_result" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Code entry points**: `src/api/mission_store/` handles persistence; `src/api/control.rs` exposes the events endpoint.

## Notes

- OpenCode config files are generated per workspace; do not keep static `opencode.json` in the repo.
- Container workspaces require root and Ubuntu/Debian tooling (systemd-nspawn).
