# Mission Testing Results

This document tracks testing of Open Agent missions to validate the architecture and identify issues.

## Test Environment

- Backend: Open Agent API (Rust)
- Frontend: Next.js Dashboard + iOS Dashboard
- OpenCode: Integration with OpenCode server
- Date Started: 2026-01-05

## Test Missions

### Mission 1: Create a Python script that generates a PDF report
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**
**Objective**: Test basic file creation and Python execution
**Expected**: Script created, dependencies installed, PDF generated
**Actual**: SUCCESS - Agent installed reportlab 4.4.7, created generate_report.py, executed successfully, generated output.pdf (1550 bytes)
**Notes**: Tested on production server (agent-backend.thomas.md) with OpenCode backend. Authentication resolved.

**Expected**: Component created, tests written and passing
**Actual**: Not yet executed
**Notes**: -

---

### Mission 7: Run a long data processing task
**Status**: ⏳ Pending
**Objective**: Test hooks (ralph-wiggum) for long-running tasks
**Expected**: Task runs to completion, hooks maintain session
**Actual**: Not yet executed
**Notes**: Test ralph-wiggum integration

---

### Mission 8: Build and run a Docker container
**Status**: ⏳ Pending
**Objective**: Test Docker operations in workspace
**Expected**: Container built and runs successfully
**Actual**: Not yet executed
**Notes**: Requires Docker in workspace

---

### Mission 9: Create a GUI app and screenshot it
**Status**: ⏳ Pending
**Objective**: Test desktop tools and picture-in-picture on iOS
**Expected**: GUI app created, screenshot visible on iOS
**Actual**: Not yet executed
**Notes**: Tests iOS PiP feature

---

### Mission 10: Parallel missions
**Status**: ⏳ Pending
**Objective**: Test resource isolation with concurrent missions
**Expected**: Multiple missions run without interference
**Actual**: Not yet executed
**Notes**: Test workspace isolation

---

## Summary Statistics (Updated Iteration 6)

- **Total Missions on Production**: 50+
- **Completed**: 26+
- **Failed**: 15
- **Active**: 9
- **Test Missions Documented**: 1/10 (Mission 1 verified)
- **Status**: ✅ **UNBLOCKED** - System operational, missions executing

**Note**: Production has executed 26+ missions successfully. However, only Mission 1 from the original test suite has been explicitly verified and documented. Missions 2-10 were queued but specific results not yet documented in this file.

## Architectural Issues Discovered

### 1. OpenCode Authentication (Critical) - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: OpenCode server requires valid Anthropic OAuth token, but token refresh fails with 400 error
- **Impact**: Cannot execute any missions through OpenCode
- **Severity**: Blocker
- **Resolution**: User authenticated OpenCode locally + OpenAI API configured
- **Deployment**: Deployed to production server (agent-backend.thomas.md)
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Missions executing successfully on production

## Improvements Implemented

### Production Deployment (2026-01-05)
1. **Rust Toolchain Update**: Updated production server from Rust 1.75.0 to 1.82.0
2. **Code Deployment**: Pulled latest code and built on production server
3. **Service Restart**: Deployed and restarted open_agent service
4. **Dev Mode**: Enabled DEV_MODE for testing (can be disabled after validation)
5. **Authentication**: Configured OpenCode with both Anthropic and OpenAI backends

### Verified Working
- ✅ Backend API responding on https://agent-backend.thomas.md
- ✅ Mission execution system functional
- ✅ OpenCode integration working
- ✅ Mission 1 completed successfully (Python PDF generation)
- ✅ Additional missions (2-5) queued and executing

## Next Steps

1. Start backend server and ensure OpenCode is running
2. Execute Mission 1 (simplest: Python PDF generation)
3. Document results and iterate through remaining missions
4. Fix any architectural issues discovered
5. Re-test failed missions after fixes
