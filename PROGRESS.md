# Open Agent Development Progress

## Iteration 1 Summary

### Completed Features

#### Backend API ✅
- **Agent Configuration System**: Created full CRUD API for agent configurations
  - `src/agent_config.rs`: Agent configuration types and storage
  - `src/api/agents.rs`: REST API endpoints
  - Storage in `.openagent/agents.json`
  - Agents combine: model selection, MCP servers, skills, commands

- **Workspace Management**: Already implemented
  - Host and Chroot workspace types
  - Full CRUD operations

#### Web Dashboard ✅
- **Agents Page** (`dashboard/src/app/agents/page.tsx`)
  - List, create, edit, delete agents
  - Model selection from providers
  - MCP server selection (checkboxes)
  - Skills selection from library
  - Commands selection from library
  - Real-time dirty state tracking

- **Workspaces Page** (`dashboard/src/app/workspaces/page.tsx`)
  - Grid view of all workspaces
  - Create new workspaces (host or chroot)
  - View workspace details in modal
  - Delete workspaces
  - Status indicators (ready, building, pending, error)

- **Navigation**: Added Agents and Workspaces links to sidebar

- **Build Status**: Both backend and dashboard compile successfully

### Existing Features (Already Implemented)
- Mission/Control page with SSE streaming
- Library management (Skills, Commands, MCPs)
- Settings page
- Console page
- File explorer
- History page

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Mission Testing**: Execute 10+ test missions to validate the architecture
2. **iOS Dashboard**: Add Agent and Workspace views to iOS app
3. **Overview Page Enhancement**: Add real metrics (CPU, RAM, network graphs)

### Medium Priority
4. **Playwright Tests**: Create comprehensive E2E tests for all pages
5. **Architectural Improvements**: Fix any issues discovered during mission testing

### Low Priority
6. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with new agent/workspace endpoints
7. **Advanced Workspace Features**: Chroot configuration options

## Technical Debt
- Need to implement actual chroot isolation (currently just creates directories)
- MCP server configuration could be more user-friendly
- No validation for agent/workspace names beyond basic checks

## Notes
- Agent configurations are stored in JSON, could migrate to database later
- Library sync works well with git
- Dashboard design follows "quiet luxury + liquid glass" aesthetic
