# Open Agent Development Progress

## Iteration 2 Summary

### Completed Features

#### Playwright Test Suite ✅
- **Test Configuration** (`dashboard/playwright.config.ts`)
  - Configured for local development and CI
  - Uses Chromium browser
  - Auto-starts dev server for testing

- **Test Files**:
  - `tests/agents.spec.ts`: Agent page tests (5 tests)
  - `tests/workspaces.spec.ts`: Workspace page tests (5 tests)
  - `tests/navigation.spec.ts`: Navigation and sidebar tests (3 tests)

- **Test Commands**:
  - `bunx playwright test`: Run all tests headless (fixed from `bun test`)
  - `bunx playwright test --ui`: Run tests with UI

- **Test Setup**:
  - Installed Playwright browsers (Firefox, Webkit)
  - Fixed test runner command (bunx instead of bun)

#### Documentation ✅
- **MISSION_TESTS.md**: Mission testing framework with 10 test cases defined
  - Created mission tracking template
  - Documented Mission 1 failure (OpenCode auth)
  - Added architectural issues section

#### Mission Testing (Attempted) ⚠️
- **OpenCode Server**: Successfully started on port 4096
- **Mission 1 Execution**: Attempted but failed due to authentication
  - Created mission via control API
  - Discovered critical blocker: OAuth token expired
  - Error: "Token refresh failed: 400"
  - Impact: Cannot execute any missions through OpenCode

## Iteration 1 Summary

### Completed Features

#### Backend API ✅
- **Agent Configuration System**: Created full CRUD API for agent configurations
  - `src/agent_config.rs`: Agent configuration types and storage
  - `src/api/agents.rs`: REST API endpoints
  - Storage in `.openagent/agents.json`
  - Agents combine: model selection, MCP servers, skills, commands

- **Workspace Management**: Already implemented
  - Host and Chroot workspace types
  - Full CRUD operations

#### Web Dashboard ✅
- **Agents Page** (`dashboard/src/app/agents/page.tsx`)
  - List, create, edit, delete agents
  - Model selection from providers
  - MCP server selection (checkboxes)
  - Skills selection from library
  - Commands selection from library
  - Real-time dirty state tracking

- **Workspaces Page** (`dashboard/src/app/workspaces/page.tsx`)
  - Grid view of all workspaces
  - Create new workspaces (host or chroot)
  - View workspace details in modal
  - Delete workspaces
  - Status indicators (ready, building, pending, error)

- **Navigation**: Added Agents and Workspaces links to sidebar

- **Build Status**: Both backend and dashboard compile successfully

#### iOS Dashboard ✅
- **AgentsView** (`ios_dashboard/OpenAgentDashboard/Views/Agents/AgentsView.swift`)
  - List agents with card view
  - View agent details (model, MCPs, skills, commands)
  - Create new agents
  - Uses completion-based async pattern

- **WorkspacesView** (`ios_dashboard/OpenAgentDashboard/Views/Workspaces/WorkspacesView.swift`)
  - Grid view of all workspaces
  - View workspace details
  - Create new workspaces (host or chroot)
  - Status badges

- **APIService Updates**: Added agent and workspace methods

### Existing Features (Already Implemented)
- Mission/Control page with SSE streaming
- Library management (Skills, Commands, MCPs)
- Settings page
- Console page
- File explorer
- History page

## Current Blockers

### OpenCode Authentication (Critical)
- **Issue**: OpenCode OAuth token expired, causing "Token refresh failed: 400"
- **Impact**: Cannot execute missions through OpenCode backend
- **Options**:
  1. Re-authenticate interactively (requires user action)
  2. Alternative: Direct Anthropic API integration
  3. Alternative: Use OpenRouter with API key
- **Next**: User must run `opencode auth login` or configure alternative auth

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Blocked)
1. **Mission Testing**: Execute 10+ test missions to validate the architecture
   - ⚠️ BLOCKED: Requires OpenCode authentication fix
2. **iOS Dashboard Testing**: Verify Agent and Workspace views work on iOS
3. **Overview Page Enhancement**: Add real metrics (CPU, RAM, network graphs)

### Medium Priority
4. **Playwright Tests**: Create comprehensive E2E tests for all pages
5. **Architectural Improvements**: Fix any issues discovered during mission testing

### Low Priority
6. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with new agent/workspace endpoints
7. **Advanced Workspace Features**: Chroot configuration options

## Technical Debt
- Need to implement actual chroot isolation (currently just creates directories)
- MCP server configuration could be more user-friendly
- No validation for agent/workspace names beyond basic checks

## Notes
- Agent configurations are stored in JSON, could migrate to database later
- Library sync works well with git
- Dashboard design follows "quiet luxury + liquid glass" aesthetic
