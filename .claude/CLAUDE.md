# Open Agent – Project Guide

Open Agent is a managed control plane for OpenCode-based agents. The backend **does not** run model inference or autonomous logic; it delegates execution to an OpenCode server and focuses on orchestration, telemetry, and workspace/library management.

## Architecture Summary

- **Backend (Rust/Axum)**: mission orchestration, workspace/container management, MCP registry, Library sync.
- **OpenCode Client**: `src/opencode/` and `src/agents/opencode.rs` (thin wrapper).
- **Dashboards**: `dashboard/` (Next.js) and `ios_dashboard/` (SwiftUI).

## Core Concepts

- **Library**: Git-backed config repo (skills, commands, agents, tools, rules, MCPs). `src/library/`. The default template is at [github.com/Th0rgal/openagent-library-template](https://github.com/Th0rgal/openagent-library-template).
- **Workspaces**: Host or container environments with their own skills, tools, and plugins. `src/workspace.rs` manages workspace lifecycle and syncs skills/tools to `.opencode/`.
- **Missions**: Agent selection + workspace + conversation. Execution is delegated to OpenCode and streamed to the UI.

## Scoping Model

- **Global**: Auth, providers, MCPs (run on HOST machine), agents, commands, rules
- **Per-Workspace**: Skills, tools, plugins/hooks, installed software (container only), file isolation
- **Per-Mission**: Agent selection, workspace selection, conversation history

MCPs can be global because and run as child processes on the host or workspace (run inside the container). It depends on the kind of MCP.

## Design Guardrails

- Do **not** reintroduce autonomous agent logic (budgeting, task splitting, verification, model selection). OpenCode handles execution.
- Keep the backend a thin orchestrator: **Start Mission → Stream Events → Store Logs**.
- Avoid embedding provider-specific logic in the backend. Provider auth is managed via OpenCode config + dashboard flows.

## Common Entry Points

- `src/api/routes.rs` – API routing and server startup.
- `src/api/control.rs` – mission control session, SSE streaming.
- `src/api/mission_runner.rs` – per-mission execution loop.
- `src/workspace.rs` – workspace lifecycle + OpenCode config generation.
- `src/opencode/` – OpenCode HTTP + SSE client.

## Local Dev

The backend must be deployed on a remote linux server and ran in debug mode (release is too slow).

```bash
# Backend (url is https://agent-backend.thomas.md but remote is 95.216.112.253)
export OPENCODE_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4096"
cargo run --debug

# Dashboard
cd dashboard
bun install
bun dev
```

## Debugging Missions

Missions are persisted in a **SQLite database** with full event logging, enabling detailed post-mortem analysis.

**Database location**: `~/.openagent/missions/missions.db` (or `missions-dev.db` in dev mode)

**Retrieve events via API**:
```bash
GET /api/control/missions/{mission_id}/events
```

**Query parameters**:
- `types=<type1>,<type2>` – filter by event type
- `limit=<n>` – max events to return
- `offset=<n>` – pagination offset

**Event types captured**:
- `user_message` – user inputs
- `thinking` – agent reasoning tokens
- `tool_call` – tool invocations (name + input)
- `tool_result` – tool outputs
- `assistant_message` – agent responses
- `mission_status_changed` – status transitions
- `error` – execution errors

**Example**: Retrieve tool calls for a mission:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/control/missions/<mission_id>/events?types=tool_call,tool_result" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Code entry points**: `src/api/mission_store/` handles persistence; `src/api/control.rs` exposes the events endpoint.

## Notes

- OpenCode config files are generated per workspace; do not keep static `opencode.json` in the repo.
- Container workspaces require root and Ubuntu/Debian tooling (systemd-nspawn).
