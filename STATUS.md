# Open Agent - Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-05 (Iteration 3)
**Overall Progress**: 60% (Infrastructure complete, testing blocked)

## Quick Summary

Open Agent has a complete web and iOS dashboard for managing agents, workspaces, and missions. The backend API is functional. However, **mission execution is blocked** due to OpenCode authentication expiration.

## What Works ✅

### Web Dashboard (Next.js + Bun)
- ✅ Agents page: UI implemented (API endpoint status unclear)
- ✅ Workspaces page: Create/manage workspaces (API verified working)
- ✅ Library page: UI implemented (needs git repo config)
- ✅ Mission page: Mission creation UI
- ✅ Overview page: Dashboard structure (needs real metrics)
- ✅ Settings page: Configuration management
- ✅ Navigation: All routes functional
- ✅ Dev server: Running on port 3001

### iOS Dashboard (SwiftUI)
- ✅ Agents view: List and create agents
- ✅ Workspaces view: List and create workspaces
- ✅ API integration: APIService methods implemented
- ⏳ Not tested in simulator yet

### Backend API (Rust + Axum)
- ✅ Health check (`/api/health`) - verified working
- ✅ Workspace endpoints (`/api/workspaces`) - verified working
- ✅ Providers/Models endpoints (`/api/providers`) - verified working
- ⚠️ Agent CRUD endpoints (`/api/agents`) - implementation exists, needs testing
- ⚠️ Library endpoints (`/api/library/*`) - requires git repo configuration
- ✅ Mission management endpoints (`/api/control/missions`) - verified working
- ✅ Control session (SSE streaming) - verified working
- ⚠️ Mission execution - blocked by OpenCode auth

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Playwright configured
- ✅ 13 E2E tests written
  - 5 tests: agents.spec.ts
  - 5 tests: workspaces.spec.ts
  - 3 tests: navigation.spec.ts
- ⏳ Test execution hangs (under investigation)

### Documentation
- ✅ PROGRESS.md: 3 iterations documented
- ✅ MISSION_TESTS.md: 10 test missions defined
- ✅ BLOCKERS.md: Comprehensive blocker analysis
- ✅ CLAUDE.md: Architecture and API reference
- ✅ STATUS.md: This file

## What's Blocked ❌

### Critical: OpenCode Authentication

**Issue**: OpenCode OAuth token expired
**Error**: `Token refresh failed: 400`
**Impact**: Cannot execute missions or test core functionality

**Affects**:
- ❌ Mission execution (0/10 test missions completed)
- ❌ Agent/workspace validation
- ❌ End-to-end workflow testing
- ❌ Playwright tests (may depend on working backend)
- ❌ iOS testing (needs working missions)

**Root Cause**:
```rust
// src/api/routes.rs:69-70
// Always use OpenCode backend
let root_agent: AgentRef = Arc::new(OpenCodeAgent::new(config.clone()));
```

Backend is hardcoded to use OpenCode, which requires OAuth authentication. Token expired after ~1 hour.

### Solutions

See BLOCKERS.md for detailed analysis. Quick options:

1. **Re-auth** (5 min): Run `opencode auth login`
2. **Alt backend** (4-8 hrs): Implement Anthropic/OpenRouter agent
3. **Hybrid** (8-16 hrs): Support multiple backends

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Unblock Testing)
1. **User action**: Re-authenticate OpenCode
   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```
2. **Verify**: Mission execution works
3. **Execute**: All 10 test missions
4. **Document**: Results in MISSION_TESTS.md

### High Priority (Complete Testing)
1. Fix Playwright test execution
2. Test iOS app in simulator
3. Validate cross-platform sync
4. Add real metrics to Overview page

### Medium Priority (Polish)
1. Implement actual chroot isolation
2. Complete Library git sync
3. Add cost tracking display
4. Improve error handling

### Long-term (Architecture)
1. Implement hybrid backend (OpenCode/Anthropic/OpenRouter)
2. Add graceful degradation
3. Improve workspace configuration
4. Enhanced monitoring/observability
